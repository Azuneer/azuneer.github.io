                <p class="main-text"> Hello dear modular music enjoyer, 
                    this website will be about modular music in general, 
                    it'll act as a blog for me but i'll also try to get news of what's happening in the modular music world, 
                    despite being a beginner. For the moment, this website is in complete construction ! So you'll have to wait for some time before it actually gets useful and ergonomic (in a certain way). 
                    Thanks for the visit and, see you later!</p>
