# Here it all starts, my website (moodal.)

Here's my we repository for my moodal. website, so if you encounter this website by any way, here's his code ! Made public lol.

At the time i can only host it on github so, it'll have to wait, i don't really plan to make my website code foss. 

This is also a ressource repo, as i'm learning to make front-end and back-end stuff, this will keep the track of my progression.

Have a nice look!
